# DATA-ANALYSIS-ND

Till now, I have done three projects in the Udacity Nanodegree course.
The Weather Trends project using Excel and SQL
The Bikeshare in US project using Python
and the TMDb Movie Analysis using Python where I have Wrangled and Explored the Data with plots and have made conclusions from the plots.   

Will be uploading the upcoming projects as and when I complete them.
